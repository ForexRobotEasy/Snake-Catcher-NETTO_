# Snake Catcher NETTO ReadMe

This ReadMe file provides an overview of the Snake Catcher NETTO code and a product description based on its functionality.

## Code Overview

The Snake Catcher NETTO code is an Expert Advisor (EA) developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. It is designed to capture rapid price movements in the forex market and enter positions accordingly. Here is a breakdown of the code:

### Expert Advisor Initialization (OnInit)

The `OnInit` function is called when the EA is initialized. It prints a message indicating that the Snake Catcher NETTO EA has been initialized.

### Expert Advisor Deinitialization (OnDeinit)

The `OnDeinit` function is called when the EA is deinitialized. It prints a message indicating that the Snake Catcher NETTO EA has been deinitialized.

### Expert Advisor Start (OnTick)

The `OnTick` function is called on every tick of the market. It checks for rapid price movements by comparing the current price with the previous price. If a price change is detected, the EA enters a position using the `OrderSend` function.

After entering a position, the EA waits for the price movement to continue by continuously checking the price change. Once the price movement stops, the EA checks if the cumulative profit level is sufficient to close all positions. If the profit level is met (100 or above), the EA iterates through all open orders and closes them using the `OrderClose` function.
